  ## Description  
  This project will generate a README.md file based on a user's response to a series of questions about the project.  

  A README.md is an essential part of an good GitHub project. It is with that in mind that I created this simple, command-line based README.md generator.

  All the user has to do is answer a few questions about their project and this tool does the rest.

  Bear in mind, although this generator will provide a basic README file, it is up to the user to customize the generated file to add as much detail and flair as they want.

  That said, there are many ways this project can be enhanced so it will produce a more polished README file that requires less editing afterwards.
